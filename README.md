# mesh2audio

Import or generate 3D models and transform them into real-time playable physical audio models!

The generated audio model can be played in real-time by "striking" (clicking) on mesh vertices in the 3D mesh viewer or by using an audio input device (such as a microphone) to excite the vertices.

- Example audio output is in the [sound_samples](sound_samples/) directory.

This project started as the final project for Karl Hiner and Ben Wilfong for GA Tech CSE-6730 Modeling & Simulation, Spring 2023.
_The code as it was at the end of the school project is [here](https://github.com/GATech-CSE-6730-Spring-2023-Project/mesh2audio)._
_This original repo also supports low-fidelity axissymmetric audio model generation._

## Build app

### Install dependencies

#### Mac

```shell
$ brew install glew llvm eigen
```

#### Linux

(Only tested on Ubuntu.)

```shell
$ sudo apt install llvm libc++-dev libc++abi-dev libeigen3-dev
$ ln -s llvm-config-17 llvm-config
$ export PATH="$(llvm-config --bindir):$PATH"
```

Install GTK (for native file dialogs) and OpenGL dependencies:

```shell
$ sudo apt install build-essential libgtk-3-dev libglu1-mesa-dev freeglut3-dev mesa-common-dev libglew-dev
```

### Clone, clean, and build app

```shell
$ git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:khiner/mesh2audio.git
$ cd mesh2audio
```

- **Clean:**
  - Clean up everything: `./script/Clean`
  - Clean debug build only: `./script/Clean -d [--debug]`
  - Clean release build only: `./script/Clean -r [--release]`
- **Build:**
  - Debug build (default): `./script/Build`
  - Release build: `./script/Build -r [--release]`

Debug build is generated in the `./build` directory relative to project (repo) root.
Release build is generated in `./build-release`.

To run the freshly built application:

```sh
# The application assumes it's being run from the build directory when locating its resource files.
$ cd build # or build-release
$ ./mesh2audio
```
